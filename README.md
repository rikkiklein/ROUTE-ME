### Technical Details

The front-end of the app was written using React JS. The back-end was written with Ruby / Ruby on Rails.

### Responsibilities

This app was mostly written by Rikki and Austin as a group. We both thought and implemented a solution to help solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.

As a group we worked on getting google auto complete to work as well as rendering the google map.

Individually Austin was in charge of setting up the routes and making the backend communicate with the front-end; with  Rikki helping design the database. Austin was in charge of getting the directions for the shortest route.

Individually Rikki was in charge of the styling of the app with the help of Austin helping to plan on how things should be laid out.
